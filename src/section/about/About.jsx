            I graduated from Eskisehir technical university in materials science
            and engineering. I was very impressed with the 'Pyhton' course you
            took in my department and started coding. During my academic career,
            I managed to accumulate about 1 year of work experience. I have had
            the privilege of working as a freelancer in a front-end developer
            role in my spare time, where I have learned valuable professional
            skills such as website architecture, programming and web page
            content. In both my academic and professional life, I have been
            consistently praised by my professors and colleagues for my hard
            work. While working on academic, extracurricular or professional
            projects, I apply my proven technical, teamwork and research skills
            that I hope to use in a Software Development role at your company.
